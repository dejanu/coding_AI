Coding in the age of AI. Github Copilot is available:

    - In your IDE
    - In GitHub Mobile, as a chat interface
    - In Windows Terminal Canary, through the Terminal Chat interface
    - On the command line, through the GitHub CLI
    - On the GitHub website

* **Context** is everything: Add files to chat `#` + Add chat participants `@` (filter things out)

* **Agents** are specialized AI tools that extend the core assistant's capabilities, acting like "apps for AI" to automate specific tasks,
